      <p class="">At JRS, our number one responsibility is to provide
        quality software to our clients or users.  At any given time, the process and
        workflow to provide such services needs to evolve.  In order to do this, we
        are constantly re-working our process to improve our productivity.  If you
        leave that last sentence the way it is, grammar should be: So, we are constantly
        re-working our process to improve our productivity.</p>

      <p>It is not easy to write quality code with tight timelines and
        complex user requirements.  We leverage several industry standards
        and proven methods that help us manage our development products and
        processes.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        Pair Programming is one of the most controversial of techniques.  We
        have found Pair Programming to be invaluable in our development process.
        Not only does it help reduce common human bugs, but it helps the
        developers to continue to share knowledge and grow.  Pair Programming
        is one of the best teaching/learning processes for new developers.

      <div class="panel-body">
        Some people think that pair programming replaces code reviews, but we feel code reviews also
        share a place in the development life-cycle.  The Code Review is focused on the code quality
        and structure.  Is the code maintainable?  Can the code be refactored to provide a simpler solution?

      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>All production code should have unit tests, no matter what the code is. The tests should be isolated
          and only test the specific code of the unit.  This goes for front-end JavaScript and back-end Serverside
          code.  Our teams are very focused on testing and it is a requirement. It is all about confidence in
          your deliverables; creating unit tests helps to increase that confidence. Unit-tests are a great way
          to document edge cases and strange bugs.</p>

        <p>Continuous Integration is an automated process that runs all of your automated test after
      every check-in to your repository.  It will alert you when your code is breaking the build.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Our main integration testing process is performed using a series of visual test cases and managed
          by our testing team.  There is also some manual testing that is performed before every release.
          This high-touch approach to integration testing allows us to focus on the core scenarios that
          can turn releases into support disasters.</p>
