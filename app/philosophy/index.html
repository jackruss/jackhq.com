      At JRS, our number one responsibility is to provide
      quality software to our clients or users.  At any given time, the process and
      workflow to provide such services needs to evolve.  In order to do this, we
      are constantly re-working our process to improve our productivity.  If you
      leave that last sentence the way it is, grammar should be: So, we are constantly
      re-working our process to improve our productivity.

      It is not easy to write quality code with tight timelines and
      complex user requirements.  We leverage several industry standards
      and proven methods that help us manage our development products and

    <p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      Pair Programming is one of the most controversial of techniques.  We
      have found Pair Programming to be invaluable in our development process.
      Not only does it help reduce common human bugs, but it helps the
      developers to continue to share knowledge and grow.  Pair Programming
      is one of the best teaching/learning processes for new developers.

      The development team works with the product team creating user-stories and a
      sprint development plan for every feature.  The time preparing helps
      prevent tangents and provides a more focused execution during
      the development sprint.

    <p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      Some people think that pair programming replaces code reviews, but we feel code reviews also
      share a place in the development life-cycle.  The Code Review is focused on the code quality
      and structure.  Is the code maintainable?  Can the code be refactored to provide a simpler solution?

      All production code should have unit tests, no matter what the code is. The tests should be isolated
      and only test the specific code of the unit.  This goes for front-end JavaScript and back-end Serverside
      code.  Our teams are very focused on testing and it is a requirement. It is all about confidence in
      your deliverables; creating unit tests helps to increase that confidence. Unit-tests are a great way
      to document edge cases and strange bugs.

      Continuous Integration is an automated process that runs all of your automated test after
      every check-in to your repository.  It will alert you when your code is breaking the build.

    <p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      Our main integration testing process is performed using a series of visual test cases and managed
      by our testing team.  There is also some manual testing that is performed before every release.
      This high-touch approach to integration testing allows us to focus on the core scenarios that
      can turn releases into support disasters.
