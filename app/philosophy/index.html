      At JRS, our number one responsibility is to provide
      quality software to our clients or users.  At any given
      time the process and workflow to provide such services need
      to evolve and we understand this.  So we are constantly,
      re-working our process to improve our productivity.

      It is not easy to write quality code with tight timelines and
      complex user requirements.  We leverage several industry standard
      and proven method that help us manage our development products and

      Pair Programming is one the most controversal of techniques.  We
      have found Pair Programming to be invaluable in our development process.
      Not only does it help reduce common human bugs, but it helps the
      developers to continue to share knowledge and grow.  Pair Programming
      is one of the best teaching/learning processes for new developers.

      The development team spends the up front time creating user-stores and a
      sprint development plan for every feature.  The time preparing up from helps
      prevent coding path tangents and provides a more focused execution during
      the development sprint.

    <p class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      Some people think that pair programming replaces code reviews, but we feel code reviews also
      share a place in the development life-cycle.  The Code Review is focused on the code quality
      and structure.  Is the code maintainable?  Can the code be refactored to provide a simpiler solution?

      All production code should have unit tests, no matter what the code is, the tests should be isolated
      and only test the specific code of the unit.  This goes for front-end JavaScript and Backend Serverside
      code.  Our teams are very focused on testing and it is a requirement. It is all about confidence in
      your deliverables, creating unit test helps to increase that confidence. Also it is a great way
      to document edge cases and strange bugs.  When checking in our code our unit test are run using
      continuous integration, no code is shipped unless covered and deployed by our CI servers.
